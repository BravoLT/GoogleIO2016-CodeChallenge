# Challenge 1 entry

Requires any recent version of Ruby, on Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux. (I happen to be using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, with Ruby 1.9.3p484)

> ruby challenge1.rb

Will output the challenge request, a list of prime numbers up to and including 101.

You can also run a custom list, by passing in a maximum value as an argument, such as :

> ruby challenge1.rb 451




# Whatever it is, it ain't local

![2, 3, 5, 7, those are all prime numbers](https://storage.googleapis.com/vidsums/ec13506b-ef42-4f14-9182-fa4d893035e1_text.gif)

In the movie Contact, aliens send a messsage revealing themselves as intelligent life as a series of prime numbers.  For 1 entry, write a program that finds all prime numbers less than or equal to 101
