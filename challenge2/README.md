SMS messaging wasn’t always as easy as a swipe over a qwerty keyboard.  There were physical buttons and you pressed a number several times to get a letter.  For example, 2 = A, 22=B, 222=C.  For 2 entries, write a program that can translate a file containing numbers in the above notation to the text representation.  Letters will use a “.” to separate characters.  Words are separated by whitespace  For example:

```
222.2.8 = CAT
3.666.4 = DOG
22.777.2.888.666 55.8 = BRAVO LT
```

For those of you who do not have a phone with letters associated to numbers, the following layout should be used:
```
|  1  |  2  |  3  |
|     | ABC | DEF |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|  4  |  5  |  6  |
| GHI | JKL | MNO |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|  7  |  8  |  9  |
|PQRS | TUV |WXYZ |
```
